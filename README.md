# Chemical Compound Builder & Visualizer

A Python application for building chemical compounds atom by atom, analyzing bonds, and visualizing molecular structures with interactive graphs.
Features
Core Functionality

    Atom Creation: Create atoms with specific atomic numbers, mass numbers, and charges

    Element Database: Comprehensive periodic table data for elements 1-118

    Bond Analysis: Automatically determines bond types (Ionic, Covalent, Metallic)

    Compound Assembly: Build compounds from multiple atoms with bond relationships

    Visualization: Generate interactive graph visualizations of chemical structures

Chemical Analysis

    Valence Electron Calculation: Automatically computes valence electrons for each atom

    Metal/Non-metal Classification: Identifies element types for bond prediction

    Ion Representation: Properly formats charged atoms (Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, etc.)

    Compound Statistics: Shows atom counts and bond relationships
